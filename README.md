👋 Hi, I’m @BrianNdege946
   I have a BSc. in Biochemistry and I'm currently pursuing an MSc. in Bioinformatics in the University of Nairobi.
   I have a great passion that lies at the intersection of data analysis and biology thus much of my work lies in learning
    how to navigate and solve the complex biological mysteries through use of available and emerging computational tools.
    
👀 I’m interested in ...
  - Data analysis using R
  - Machine learning and its applications in bioinformatics
  - Omics especially genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics
  - Invention and development of algorithms and computational tools
  - Computational and systems biology.
    
🌱 I’m currently learning ...
   - High-throughput sequencing data analysis and visualization in R
   - Artificial intelligence and expert systems, pattern recognition, data mining, algorithms
   - Advanced machine learning techniques
   - Scientific computing and quantitative methods.
     
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
   - Omics data analysis
   - Any fascinating bioinformatics research project
   - Open-source bioinformatics tools.

⚡ Fun fact: ...
  - Interestingly, my background is Biochemistry but just like the concept of evolution,
   I fell in love with this beautiful discipline of Bioinformatics.
  - Data in its form, can reveal hidden patterns and life mysteries, something that ever fascinates me.
  - In the words of Ryan Bethencourt, "Our world is built on biology and once we begin to
    understand it, it becomes a technology"
